Summary and Result:
Summary and Result: I had some datasets from the UK. We put a rule in place to understand whether or not it impacts a range of accidents. Dataset’s reference: E. B. Andersen (1991), The Statistical Analysis of Categorical Data, Table 6.8. (Also, it existed in the vcd package) and this channelhttps://youtu.be/j9YFazcAjB4, have contributed to me completing my project. I used “ggplot” for visualization and some models for analysis, like Logit. However, there was challenge at the end, I just considered binary interaction, calculation and visualize triple one is so challenging and time consuming. But without being crippled by that, I recognized 3 factors that had influenced me: light, park or not and before and after November. Parked cars with shiny streets and cars with movements without light have been damaged from the back, and cars with movements with light and parked on a dark street have been damaged from the front.

Summary and Result:
I had some datasets from UK. We put a rule to understand does it have impact on range of accident or not. Dataset’s reference: E. B. Andersen (1991), The Statistical Analysis of Categorical Data, Table 6.8. (Also, it existed in vcd package) and I this channelhttps://youtu.be/j9YFazcAjB4 have contributed me to complete my project. I used “ggplot” for visualization and use some models for analysis like Logit. However, there was challenge at the end, I just considered binary interaction, calculation and visualize triple one is so challenging and time consuming. But without been crippled by that, I recognized 3 factors has influenced: light, park or not and before and after November. Parked cars with shiny street and cars with movements without light has damaged from back and cars with movements with light and parked one at dark street has damaged from forward.
